# Project Overview
Potato is an important crop that is susceptible to various diseases. Early detection and classification of these diseases are crucial for preventing yield losses. This project aims to develop a classification system that can accurately identify different diseases affecting potato plants using deep learning techniques.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images of healthy potato plants as well as plants affected by three common diseases: 'Potato___Early_blight', 'Potato___Late_blight' and  'Potato___healthy. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.
